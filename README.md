# organelle_PBA2

Organelle PBA2 is a organelle genome assembler using Third Generation sequencing datasets like PacBIO or Oxford Nanopore. Following the original Organelle_PBA's (https://github.com/aubombarely/Organelle_PBA) premises it captures long reads from organelles by mapping reads to a reference genome.

The following software is required in order to run Organelle_PBA2:

Python3
Biopython (https://biopython.org/wiki/Download)
BLAST suite (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download)
FiltLong (https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong)
